# scrnaseq-workflows

This is a repo for developing workflows for scRNAseq processes. 


# Process Notes

This has process updates and status for the scRNAseq workflow work. It's intended to be informative and not polished/pretty.


### To Do, Current

* Hello-world for Slurm / Gizmo, document the steps


* Hello-world for Cromwell, document the steps
* Hello-world for Nextflow, document the steps


### Blocked

* Re-run the scRNAseq workflow scripts RobA (workflow A) provided using my credentials (on rhino)
   * Use https://www.biostars.org/p/174331/ to get the hg38 files
* Re-run a second scRNAsew workflow (workflow B) - *from Valentin?*


### Upcoming

* Convert workflow A to Slurm, document the steps
* Convert workflow A to Snakemake, document the steps
* Convert workflow A to Cromwell, document the steps
* Convert workflow A to Nextflow, document the steps

* Convert workflow B to Slurm, document the steps
* Convert workflow B to Snakemake, document the steps
* Convert workflow B to Cromwell, document the steps
* Convert workflow B to Nextflow, document the steps

* Evaluate everything - *use matrix prioritization for scoring?*
