# scrnaseq-workflows

This is a repo for developing workflows for scRNAseq processes. 


# Process Notes

This has process updates and status for the scRNAseq workflow work. It's intended to be informative and not polished/pretty.


### To Do, Current

* Re-run the scRNAseq workflow scripts RobA (workflow A) provided using my credentials (on rhino)

* Hello-world for slurm / gizmo, document the steps
* Hello-world for Cromwell, document the steps
* Hello-world for Snakemake, document the steps
* Hello-world for Nextflow, document the steps


### Blocked, Waiting

* Re-run a second scRNAsew workflow (workflow B) - *from Valentin?*

* Convert workflow A to slurm, document the steps
* Convert workflow A to Snakemake, document the steps
* Convert workflow A to Cromwell, document the steps
* Convert workflow A to Nextflow, document the steps

* Convert workflow B to slurm, document the steps
* Convert workflow B to Snakemake, document the steps
* Convert workflow B to Cromwell, document the steps
* Convert workflow B to Nextflow, document the steps

* Evaluate everything - *matrix prioritization for scoring?*


### Done
